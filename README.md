# CP_Template

**Hii !!":smile:**

This is the template I use for competitive programming.
I use c++ for competitive programming like most of the programmers.

As you can see my [template](./template.cpp) is very short. The reason is I don't really need all other shortcuts and debugging features yet because I still can't solve all the problems in any contest.

When I am able to do that and I want to reduce time while coding I will gradually add more micros and other useful features in the template.



#### **NOTE** : 
I will also be adding all the problem links in a new file in this repo which I find intersting and tough ðŸ’ª .
